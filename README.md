Kana Reading Practice Project
------------
What it is
- After you learn the basics of hiragana and katakana, you need practice! 
- Practicing individual characters is useful, but being able to read fluently means reading whole words, almost without thinking about it
- this collects a list of JLPT N5 verbs, and lets users practice writing the romaji equivalent of the given word
- as a bonus, it also displays the meanings of the words, so you can also pickup the words meanings

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- the bulk of the logic is in `client.js`, and it uses vanilla javscript (for now)

On the back-end,
- the app starts at `server.js`
